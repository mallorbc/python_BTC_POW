# Pyhon BTC POW Algorithm

This repo contains code the demonstrates the Bitcoin SHA256 POW algorithm in python.  In this code, the data being hashed is not transaction data, but it could easily be. This code demonstrates the ability to hash different data, demonstrates the impact of increasing difficulty, and demonstrates the benifits of parrallel computing for hashing POW algorithms.

Run ```python main.py -h``` for run flags
